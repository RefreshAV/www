For this popup Startup Life entrepreneur chat over beers, we will be hosting Avery Schrader, a Nova Scotian living abroad in Tallinn, Estonia.  Estonia, for those not in the know, is a tiny Baltic state,  but in tech terms it's a giant. It has a population of just 1.3 million, yet produces more start-ups per head than any other country in Europe.
 
Avery is the founder of Modash, a tool that enables marketing teams to find and verify the audiences of over 50,000,000 influencers globally. Modash has raised $300,000 in funding from successful founders who have started companies like Pipedrive, Veriff, Yes.com and more. 

More, Avery successfully launched a Podcast which enabled him to sit down and interview world class founders and investors like Taizo Son (the billionaire CEO of Mistletoe capital), Peter Vesterbacka (Angry Birds) and many many more. He also mentors for Startupwiseguys, a leading accelerator in CEE and Scandinavia. 

Come join us for a Friday after work beer (or soda) -- on us -- and chat with Avery.  Learn about influencer marketing, how Modash is poised to be a key global player in this space, and lessons from the Estonian digital tech startup ecosystem.
