### Calling All Classic Gamers!

The Retro Video Game Jam is a celebration of the video games of yesteryear.  From the 1970s to early 2000s, we will explore the arcade, console, and PC games that defined eras gone by.  Our game jam will include a pop-up museum, fan-made DYI retro arcade, game tournaments, and workshops.

We are currently seeking collaborators who wish to contribute to this event.  Examples of contributions could include:

* Content for our pop-up museum (consoles, CRT TVs)
* Workshops on diverse topics: history of video games, game building how-tos, etc.
* Fan art
* Costumes
* 8bit DJing
* Event volunteers (help with setup, operations, clean up)
* Sponsors!
* Insert your big idea here

Call For Contributors will run until February 28.
