Business-hypothesis-driven experimentation.  Iterative product releases. Validated learning.  Pivot. Pivot. Pivot.  Welcome to the tech startup world of {{<person "John Frost">}}. 

From the early days of Frostbyte Interactive, Aerhyve Aerial Technologies, and now PrecisionHawk, John's pursuit of innovative products and services in the digital tech space runs years long.  Join us for a fireside chat with John where we will explore the inner working of a person committed to the startup life.  We will examine his failures, study lessons learned from the startup trenches, and most importantly celebrate his successes.   

John's story is one also of the Annapolis Valley startup community.  As a tenant of the Rural Innovation Centre at Acadia University from day one, we will also explore how we are fairing in incubating innovative within our community. 

A continuation of their always entertaining profiles of amazing Nova Scotia talent, {{<organization "We Are NS">}} champions Wes Booth and Jessy Gervais will be our guides for the evening.
