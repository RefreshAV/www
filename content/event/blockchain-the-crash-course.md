This 4 hour crash course will get attendees up-to-speed on the world of cryptocurrency and the technology that powers much of it: Blockchain.

This unique opportunity runs from 5PM to 9PM, and is limited to 20 attendees.  Dinner and snacks provided.


## Part 1: Intro to Blockchain Fintech

The Bitcoin Blockchain just had its 10 year anniversary on January 3rd, 2019. With several monumental crashes and rushes in its market, no one could say with certainty whether or not the network would be a success.

However, since the inception of Bitcoin, a large variety of other Internet currencies have made their way onto the world stage, in an attempt to gain a share of the total market capital of the "cryptosphere." These coins compete for dominance on a 24/7, wild west, globally unregulated marketplace of coins.

While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are an amazing innovation in their own right, they only but scratch the surface of what Blockchain in general can do for us as a global society. 

This first part of the presentation we will explore why Blockchain has the potential to create revolutionary changes in the financial sector.

## Part 2: A Technical Intro to Blockchain

In this technical introduction to Blockchain, we will get our hands dirty setting up Blockchain software on our laptops. Attendies will then learn how to sign transactions and transfer coins between peers for a demonstration of how it works on real wallets. 

Get a head start into setting up a blockchain on your computer. Be part of the rare and in-demand talent pool of technologists who know how to run/build/work a Blockchain!
