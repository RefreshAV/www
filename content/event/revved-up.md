March 23 to 24th is launchbox's <a href="http://acadiaentrepreneurshipcentre.com/launchbox/start-it-up/">Start It Up!</a> - a weekend business ideation competition with 10K in prizes to be won.  If you are interested in playing with new business ideas, this event is for you.  While an University event, we have had youth teams (and winning youth teams!) at several Start It Up! competitions.  This year is no different.  

If you are interested in learning more about this business ideation event, come to this information session and beef up on your skills to help you compete.  We'll discuss the event format, review tools, and hear from a profesional public speaker on how to nail a presentation.  

We'll order some pizza half way through to keep us going.

First time Hoisters need to get a parent or guardian to <a href="https://form.jotform.ca/71164477795267">fill out the consent form</a>.
