Marketing is forever changing.  What works one week does not necessarily work the next.  Join {{< person "Duncan Ebata" >}}, {{< person "Evan Hill" >}}, and {{< person "Ashley Greene" >}} for a marketing insiders discussion on how to stay on the curve.   They will explore why and how empathizing and understanding customers can be game changing; how to "growth hack" your marketing to double your results at half the cost; and time saving and low cost tools for marketing.
