## What is Godot ## 

Godot is a free game engine that enables you to create any 2D or 3D experience you can dream up. It’s an all in one tool for building games for many different platforms such as desktop, mobile, and the web. Godot is friendly to beginners, and gives you the power to make amazing things.

It is recommended that you have an understanding of basic programming concepts before taking this course (like 
Scratch, for example), however, it is not required.
