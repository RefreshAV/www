Build: Arcade is an introductory Computer Science course for Middle (grades 5 to 8) or High School learners.  Using Makecode Arcade, we 
will build retro style video games.  While exploring the early history of video games, we will learn the fundamentals of 
the Makecode Arcade game development engine.  

Makecode Arcade is a great first step into the world of video game development, as well as the larger world of Computer 
Science.  No prior coding experience necessary.  

## Format ##

This 5 day intensive will be broken down into 4 daily sections:

* 10:30 to 12 - Morning Unit
* 12:00 to 12:45 - Lunch (pizza provided), and casual bouldering (if desired)
* 12:45 to 2:15 - Afternoon Unit
* 2:15 to 3:00 - Lab time

Class size is restricted to 6 to facilitate a hands-on learning environment between mentors and learners.  
Computers, pizza, and snacks provided.

Depending on interest, we will run one cohort of Middle or High School learners.

The cost for the week is sliding scale, starting at $200.
