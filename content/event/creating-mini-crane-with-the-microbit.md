Are you interested in robotics or do you enjoy messing around with electronics? In this workshop, you'll assemble both the hardware and software needed to create a miniature crane controlled by the micro:bit microcontroller.

## What is a micro:bit?

The micro:bit is a small, compact computer based on a 43 mm Ã— 52 mm circuit board. The board is easy to program and has several cool hardware features such as a processor, radio and Bluetooth antenna, 25 LED lights, two buttons, a compass, an accelerometer, and, the best feature, an edge connector used to power a wide variety of external hardware.

## The Mini Crane Project

The creation of the mini crane with the micro:bit consists of two stages, hardware and software. The hardware stage consists of wiring an already pre-made crane model on a breadboard, a small plastic board where wires and electronics are compactly connected. In the software section of the creation process, the code needed to give the mini crane functionality will be made using Microsoft MakeCode's JavaScript-based block code editor. Once both of these sections in development are complete, the micro:bit will be hooked up to the mini crane model to make a functional machine.

## What Will I Gain from this Workshop?

After doing this workshop, you will know how to install and run code on the micro:bit using JavaScript-based block code. You will also learn the basics of how a breadboard works and how to create circuits with one. Most importantly, you will learn how to make software that you create control hardware in the real world.

**Pizza + workshop + building**

Bring your own laptop. A small number of laptops will be available to borrow.
