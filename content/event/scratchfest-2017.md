# Calling all Scratchers

_#ScratchFest_ is a weekend (June 24th and June 25th) Scratch-a-thon for kids interested in creating amazing original work with the Scratch programming environment.

During _#ScartchFest_, kids will brainstorm an idea, develop their project, and showcase a final prototype.  This weekend warrior event provides an excellent opportunity for Scratch coders to invent their own projects and demonstrate their knowledge in Scratch within a collaborative, creative, and playful environment.

Scratchers will work on projects in 1 of 3 categories:

- **Interactive Artwork:**  Abstract, conceptual, or just plain weird, interactive artwork projects explore the combination of visuals and sound to create unique interactive presentations.
- **Interactive Stories:**  With Scratch interactive story projects, you will take your audience through an amazing world of your own creation.
- **Video Games:**  Action, strategy, roll playing, sports.... build your own game for your players to compete at.

Working in teams of up to 2, or working solo, Scratchers aged 8 to 13 of various skill levels will earn points from the community to take home top dog prizes.

## Win Big!

Over **$500** in prizes will be awarded for the best in category projects.  Hint: the prizes are related to the three categories of projects.

## Register

Pre-registration is required.
