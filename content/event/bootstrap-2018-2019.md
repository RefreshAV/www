Refresh Annapolis Valley has been rocking the world of Computer Science and New Media circa 2012. We've built friendships, business relationships, helped form new statups, educated each other, helped rear the next generation.... We've accomplished tons.

The 2018 - 2019 season is upon us!  Organizers, visionaries, and supporters of all descriptions, come join us for an action oriented discussion on what our new season should look like.  What sort of monthly meetup topics would you like to see?  Special events?  Youth programming? 

Think big and come hungry.  Eventbrite RSVP so we know how much pizza to order.
