**What is the future of education in a networked world?**

In this documentary screening and discussion, we will discuss Indian professor Sugata Mitra's calls for a revolution in how and what we learn. With a global network of information a few clicks away, Mitra argues that the Victorian model on which our school systems are based is obsolete.

School In The Cloud follows a three-year experiment as Mitra installs unmanned internet kiosks in locations ranging from remote villages in West Bengal to a school in northeast England, to enable children to self-organize their learning. The film explores the impact of Sugataâ€™s work, predominantly through the experience of children in the remote Indian village of Korakati in the Ganges Delta.

As children encounter the internet for the first time, will they be able to use it to transform their futures?

Join **Dr. M. Lynn Aylward** (Acadia, School of Education - research interests include inclusive education), **Ian McKay** (ex teacher and maker, home school advocate), **Dr. Gregory MacKinnon** (Acadia, School of Education - research interest in instructional technologies), **Dr. Michael Corbett** (Acadia, School of Education - research interest in educational sociology), **Dr. Leo Elshof** (Acadia, School of Education - research interest in environmental and sustainability education) for a conversation about the networked world and it's role in education today.
