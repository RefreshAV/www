The world is bubbling over with data.   When analyzed, data can provide the inquiring mind with useful information that can suggest outcomes and support decision-making.  Be it the data generated about business practices, human behaviours, the biological world; being able to understand what your data is telling you is incredibly empowering.  "R" is a free, accessible, and powerful programming language that offers a suite of tools for data analysis.

Our tour guide, {{<person "Trevor Avery">}} &mdash; biostatistician, faculty member at Acadia University, and coordinator of {{<organization "R-bar">}} &mdash; will provide us a primer on R. Through a series of examples, he will demonstrate the various strength of R in data analysis and data visualization.  No experience with programming is required to learn about what R can do for you. Just bring your inquiring mind.
