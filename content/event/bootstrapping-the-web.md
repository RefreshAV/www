For our first Hoist meetup, we'll be learning how to use the Twitter Bootstrap code library to create beautiful front-end websites. Bootstrap is a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow you to write very little but get a whole lot.  We'll start with the basics of HTML and CSS and then dive into using Bootstrap to jump-start your web project.
