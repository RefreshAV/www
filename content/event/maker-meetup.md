Calling all **makers**, **inventors**, **artists**, **entrepreneurs**, **tinkerers**, and the like. Join Refresh Annapolis Valley and Annapolis Valley STEAMspace for what we hope will be a regular meetup for the Valley maker community to gather, share ideas, and build community.

Projects galore to explore!

* {{< person "Ian McKay" >}} will be demoing a magic cauldron, CNC stuff and a possible new product.
* {{< person "Max Caplan" >}} will show off a homebrew handheld gaming console.

And you...?

If you want to bring a project in to show off and get feedback on, please do. 

Food, Makers, Cool Projects, Good Chats.
