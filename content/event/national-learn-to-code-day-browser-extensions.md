Join thousands of Canadians coast to coast to coast taking their first steps learning about Computer Science.

At this "Women Learning Code" event, we will learn how to build web browser extensions with JavaScript. Browser extensions extend your web browser with additional features, modify web pages, and integrate your browser with the other services you use.  Extensions can help customize our browsing experience or increase productivity by reducing repetitive tasks. 

In this workshop, we will use code as a tool for empowerment, to develop agency and harness change by building our own extension for Google Chrome!  We'll learn the basics of JavaScript and use this programming language to interact with websites to perform tasks like replacing or modifying content. We’ll explore ethics around extensions to help learners protect their privacy online. Learners will utilize developer tools to explore how a web page is structured and leave with a personalized extension installed in their browser. 

Never coded before? Have no prior experience with Computer Science? No problem! This workshop is designed for absolute beginners!

During the workshop, you'll learn:

* learn basic programming techniques and concepts that are translatable to other programming languages
* review the basic building blocks of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create richer online experiences
* load and update extensions using Chrome’s developer mode
* modify and replace elements using JavaScript (more kittens on the web!)
* get an idea of the resources available in order to continue learning


What you must bring:

* A laptop, and power cord. (Don't have a laptop? We will have a few available for borrowing)
* A buddy!  This is a bring a buddy event.  Dudes are required to bring a women friend (moms, grandmoms, and sisters totally count)
* 4 hours of your time!  This is a deep learning workshop!
* Come hungry.  We will be serving pizza :) 

Don't forget to get your ticket for the event. Space is limited!
