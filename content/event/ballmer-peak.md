When surveying a bunch of #Refreshers what we should do for July:

A) Take off and enjoy the sun (47.1%)

B) Keep on trucking - regular Refresh meetup for July (35.3%)

C) Other - drink beer (17.6%)

... so we drink beer! 

Join us for a crazy selection of craft beer, pizza and banter. Bring your laptop and we can put the Ballmer Peak to the test**. Come chat about the BIG plans for Refresh in September and beyond... 

** Designated driver required
