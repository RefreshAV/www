For this Hoist meetup, we will be doing something a little different.  We are looking for a few budding teen entrepreneurs to start a business.  This is the pitch:

_Services supporting the business startup space in Rural Nova Scotia are diverse and not well represented as a whole.  Our business aims to unify the Western Nova business startup ecosystem by building a coherent communication platform.  By doing so, we will encourage entrepreneurship within our community._

We are looking for teens with a range of interests to flesh out this initiative:

* **Designer**: Logos, web design, brand aesthetics. 
* **Software development**: HTML, JavaScript, server management.
* **Business development**: Idea generation, shape features, market fit, competitive landscape, research.
* **Marketing and sales**: Evangelism, blogging, advertising.
* **Content management**: Master wordsmith, create original content.
* **Accounting**: Budgeting, account receivables.

Don't have mad skillz to share, no problem.  You just need passion.  We will learn as we go, bringing in subject matter experts to beef up our skill set.


Bring your own laptop. A small number of laptops will be available to borrow.
