Have the next (big or small) idea, no budget, or development skills?  No problem -- you shouldn't start with building anyway.  

In this hands on workshop we will explore pre-product design tools that anyone can pick up to express their app idea.  With these tools you will walk away with a means to engage your user base to test concepts, gather feedback quickly, very inexpensively, and early on in the product cycle. 

Don't have a big idea?  You will eventually.  We will have some starter ideas on hand for you to play with.  Come build your innovation skill set with us.
