Computer programming is the art, craft and science of writing programs which define how computers operate. This workshop, lead by Jodrey School of Computer Science alumn {{< person "Tim Cooper" >}}, will teach you how to write computer programs using a programming language designed by Google named Go.  Learn the basics as we design an AI to interact in a multiplayer game with the other participants in the workshop.

Go is a general purpose programming language with advanced features and a clean syntax. Because of its wide availability on a variety of platforms, its robust well-documented common library, and its focus on good software engineering principles, Go is an ideal language to learn as your first programming language.
