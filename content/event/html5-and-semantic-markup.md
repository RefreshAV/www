Come join us for "HTML5 and Semantic Markup," a discussion about HTML5, markup, and HTML5 websites that rock.

#### Open Web Platform: HTML5 and Semantic Markup
Mike Caplan will give a talk about HTML5's new elements and attributes that allow us to define semantically meaningful HTML. Semantics you say? What is the meaning of this? Come find out.

#### HTML5 Websites Show and Tell
Dust off your favorite website that uses anything under the HTML5 sun â€“ offline storage, connectivity, file access, semantics, audio/video, 3D/graphics, presentation, performance, big features, or small. We'll put it on the screen and you can give a brief tour. Stickers for all those who participate.
