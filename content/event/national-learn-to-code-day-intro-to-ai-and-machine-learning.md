Join hundreds of Canadians coast to coast to coast taking their first steps learning about Computer Science. National Learn to Code Day was launched by Ladies Learning Code 5 years ago!

At this "Women Learning Code" event, we will learn about Artificial intelligence and machine learning. From Siri on your iPhone to Google Map suggestions, to recommendations for purchases during your Amazon check-out, AI is all around us.

AI and machine learning at its core is about data - and ways to make meaning of data. In this hands on workshop, we’ll learn how to put data to use for us in our everyday lives.

Never coded before? Have no prior experience with Computer science? No problem! This workshop is designed for absolute beginners!

During the workshop, you'll learn:

* The history of artificial intelligence and machine learning
* Strategies for collection, preparation, manipulation and analysis of data
* How to build your very own machine learning model to evaluate data that’s interesting to you
* Available resources to continue learning at home


What you must bring:

* A potluck item
* A laptop, and power cord. (Don't have a laptop? We will have a few available for borrowing)
* 6 hours of your time!  This is a deep learning workshop!

Don't forget to get your ticket for the event. Space is limited! Dudes welcome!
