Design Thinking is being used by large innovative companies to create exceptional products and experiences (think Google Glass, AirBnB, your arrival experience with major airlines, and, of course, toilet paper). It can also be applied at much smaller scales - in education, to find solutions for sustainability challenges, and of course in tech companies of any size. Join {{< person "Anne Stieger" >}} for an introduction to this powerful toolbox, process and mindset for user-centered design.

Come get a taste of Design Thinking, then take a deep dive into Anne's upcoming workshop with {{< organization "Digital Nova Scotia" >}} : <a href="https://www.digitalnovascotia.com/events/fostering-creativity-effective-ideation/">
