Scratch Masters is the next level course for graduates of the Creative Computing program.  Within this course we continue 
to explore the world of the computer sciences.  This course uses the popular [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) programming environment to aid
young people (grades 4 to 6) in learning the more advanced concepts of Scratch software development.  Scratch is used over the world by
students to easily create interactive artwork, interactive stories, and video games while acting as a stepping stone
to the more advanced world of computer science.

The course will also introduce students to other computer science physical computing platforms such as the [Makey Makey](https://makeymakey.com/), 
and [BBC Micro:bit](https://microbit.org/).  Other topics could include website development, and retro video game development with [Microsoft Makecode](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/makecode/teach/arcade).   

## Course Objectives ##

First and foremost, we aim to provide opportunities for young learners to become exposed to the computer sciences.   
Our goal is to provide a learning environment that goes beyond what students are taught in public schools about the  
computer sciences.  We will explore software as an interdisciplinary creative act.

## Who Am I? ##

Mike has been active as a web application developer and designer since the late 90s, working in the non-profit,
university, retail, agricultural, and health care industries. Mike is the Software Development Manager for the
Labnet Dental Lab Systems division of Henry Schein - a solutions company for health care professionals.  Mike has
been teaching the Creative Computing program since 2017.

I believe that offering an extracurricular course on Scratch and beyond will help this generation develop a fundamental
literacy around the computer sciences.
