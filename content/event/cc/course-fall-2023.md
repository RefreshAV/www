Creative Computing is a course developed by an international network of educators passionate about exposing kids to 
the computer sciences.  This course uses the popular Scratch programming environment to aid 
young people (grades 4 to 6) in learning the basics of software development.  Scratch is used over the world by 
students to easily create interactive artwork, interactive stories, and video games while acting as a stepping stone 
to the more advanced world of computer science.

## Course Objectives ##

First and foremost, we aim to provide opportunities for young learners to become exposed to the computer sciences.   
Our goal is to provide a learning environment that goes beyond what students are taught in public schools about the  
computer sciences.  We will explore software as an interdisciplinary creative act.

## Who Am I? ##

Mike has been active as a web application developer and designer since the late 90s, working in the non-profit, 
university, retail, agricultural, and health care industries. Mike is the Software Development Manager for the 
Labnet Dental Lab Systems division of Henry Schein - a solutions company for health care professionals.  Mike has 
been teaching the Creative Computing program since 2017. 

I believe that offering an extracurricular course on Scratch will help this generation develop a fundamental 
literacy around the computer sciences.
