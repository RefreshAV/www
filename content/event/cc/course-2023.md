> We are thrilled to be opening up our Winter 2023 Creative Computing Course for registration for the Wolfville

> cohort of learners for *free* for Wolfville School Students. Registration is open until Jan. 27.

Creative Computing is a course developed by an international network of educators passionate about exposing kids to 
the computer sciences.  This course uses the popular Scratch programming environment to aid 
young people (grades 4 to 6) in learning the basics of software development.  Scratch is used over the world by 
students to easily create interactive artwork, interactive stories, and video games while acting as a stepping stone 
to the more advanced world of computer science.

## Course Objectives ##

First and foremost, we aim to provide opportunities for young learners to become exposed to the computer sciences.   
Our goal is to provide a learning environment that goes beyond what students are taught in public schools about the  
computer sciences.  We will explore software as an interdisciplinary creative act.

## Who Are We? ##

Mike has been active as a web application developer and designer since the late 90s, working in the non-profit, 
university, retail, agricultural, and health care industries. Mike is the Software Development Manager for the 
Labnet Dental Lab Systems division of Henry Schein - a solutions company for health care professionals.  Mike has 
been teaching the Creative Computing program since 2017. 

Teen mentors:

* Sadie
* Sophia
* Oliver

We believe that offering an extracurricular course on Scratch will help this generation develop a fundamental 
literacy around the computer sciences.

## Format ##

{{< pic src="images/project/creative-computing/format.jpg" title="Format" align="right" >}}

Creative Computing will run weekly. Each class will run for 1.5 hours for a total of 8 classes.

The class will follow a four unit curriculum.  Units are broken down into several exercises that range from 15 to 60 
minutes a piece.   The class mentors will share teaching and mentoring responsibilities.  We will aim to have a 5  
students to 1 mentor ratio.


## Class Size ##

{{< pic src="images/project/creative-computing/size.jpg" title="Class Size" align="right" >}}

The class will be capped at 20 learners.  The grade of students sought will be between 4 and 6. 
Where historically such classes tend to be predominantly male, we will limit student spots for boys to 50% in order to 
promote diverse gender participation.

## Class Location ##

The class will be hosted by Wolfville School in the computer lab.  

## Requirements ##

None!  Students will be provided a Chromebook as well as snack.
