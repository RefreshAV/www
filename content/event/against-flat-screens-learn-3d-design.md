In this Hoist teen design talk, Max Caplan will introduce us to 3D design using Blender.  Blender is a professional 3D computer graphics software used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, interactive 3D applications and video games.  Max will walk us through installing, using, and designing your first Blender project: an awesome robot.
