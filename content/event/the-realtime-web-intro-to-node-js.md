Node.js is a rapidly growing technology that has been making big waves in the world of web development. Node lets you easily build fast and scalable network applications perfect for the realtime web. In this workshop you’ll learn how to get started using Node, its background and history, and the problems it seeks to address. We’ll get our hands dirty building a realtime chat server to get a feel for the amazing power of Node.

If you adore building application for the web, this workshop is for you. Not a web ninja? No worries. A basic understanding of web technologies is recommended (how your web browser works, HTML and JavaScript) is recommended, but not required. If you get the WWW and have ever fooled with code, you’ll get enough out of this workshop to be dangerous.
