Rural Canada feeds our nation literally, economically, and environmentally.  It provides the food, fiber, minerals, water and other bio-resources and natural resources on which our country depends and the arteries of transportation by which they are delivered.  Digital technologies and data analytics can help us shape how we work with these resources and their impact on our local communities and our planet.

### Mission ###

To advance knowledge in data analytics through collaborative and interdisciplinary research, education and outreach and to foster the ethical application and commercialization of data analytic solutions to challenges facing industry, government and society in rural Canada. The institute will initially focus on agriculture, food production, the environment, and green energy.

### Goals and Objectives ###

The goals of the Acadia Institute for Data Analytics are to foster collaboration and the sharing of data analytics methods, technologies, and ethical practices among its stakeholders. 

More specifically, the Institute will gather active stakeholders as members (academic researchers, teachers, associations, companies, government departments, etc.); foster communications and collaboration among members; communicate and coordinate relevant meetings and other events; and make connections with other data analytics organizations.  The Institute will share knowledge of technologies and methods and promote the ethical use of data analytics methods that protect the privacy of individuals and the security and integrity of data.

The objectives of the Acadia Institute for Data Analytics can be divided into four categories:

 * Promotion and Outreach: To provide visibility for data analytics initiatives undertaken by members and communicate relevant events to industry, government and the public.  To make the institute relevant to rural business and industry.  To foster sharing of knowledge and use of data analytics through vehicles such as web inventories of member competencies and resources.
 * Research:  To encourage, facilitate and leverage fundamental and interdisciplinary research and to attract high quality visiting scholars.  To work with members to provide shared technical infrastructure for research and development where possible.
 * Education: To facilitate the development and delivery of educational programs such as short courses, training workshops, and seminars that are focused on the needs of members.
 * Application and Commercialization: To foster the development of innovative applications for use in academia, industry and government.  To establish Nova Scotia as a leader in the application of data analytics to rural problems. To stimulate technology transfer, commercialization and the development of new startups.
