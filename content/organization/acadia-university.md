Far above the dykes of Fundy<br>
And its basin blue<br>
Stands our noble alma mater<br>
Glorious to view

Lift the chorus<br>
Speed it onward<br>
Sing it loud and free<br>
Hail to thee our alma mater<br>
Acadia, hail to thee

Far above the busy highway<br>
And the sleepy town<br>
Raised against the arch of heaven<br>
Looks she proudly down
