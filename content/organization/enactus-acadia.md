Enactus Acadia is a small chapter of a global organization that unites students with academic and business leaders. We implement various projects in the community that help improve the quality of life and standard of living for those in need. Enactus Acadia currently has multiple projects underway, which fit into categories such as eco-living, youth empowerment, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship.
