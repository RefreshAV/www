We're all about local.  Our apples are grown in nearby orchards, pressed into juice just down the road, and fermented into cider at our cidery in downtown Wolfville. Come for a tour, enjoy a tasting and tap into the valley.
 
The Annapolis Valley is who we are, it’s where we live and we couldn’t be more proud to call it home.

Annapolis Cider Company is a supporter of Refresh Annapolis Valley.
