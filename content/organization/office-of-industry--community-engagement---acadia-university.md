Acadia’s Office of Industry & Community Engagement (ICE), identifies and connects Acadia’s researchers with industry, government and community groups interested in research, commercialization, outreach and entrepreneurship activities.  As a member of Springboard Atlantic, ICE works with other universities in Atlantic Canada, as well as incubators and accelerators to ensure Acadia is making a strong contribution to the development and prosperity of our local and regional communities.
