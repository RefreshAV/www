WISE (Women in Science and Engineering) at Acadia is a group of female faculty members from the [Faculty of Pure and Applied Science](http://science.acadiau.ca/) and [Kinesiology](http://kinesiology.acadiau.ca/) who gather together to address the unique issues that women in academia face. The group has supported learning opportunities and award applications for Acadia women faculty members. After a [gathering held in October 2014](http://bit.ly/WISEacadia) additional WISE priorities have been identified related to mentoring, science camps for young women, and a course offering for undergraduates in Women and Science. 

WISE has been supported in these endeavours by members of the Women's and Gender Studies program. The mission of WGS is to foster a vibrant, dynamic campus community that critically engages with issues of gender, sexuality, race, class and ability. Working together with science students and faculty, WGS strives to remedy inequities and draw attention to opportunities facing women in the sciences.
