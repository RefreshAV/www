The Valley Regional Enterprise Network (Valley REN) was incorporated in March 2014 under the Municipal Government Act. The partnership comprises the Glooscap First Nation; Municipality of the County of Kings; Municipality of the District of West Hants; and the Towns of Berwick, Kentville, Middleton, Windsor and Wolfville. It is led by a volunteer Board of Directors, drawn mostly from the private sector and bringing to the table a wealth of experience in business and economic leadership.
