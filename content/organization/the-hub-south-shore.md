The HUB South Shore is a coworking space that connects progressive businesses and people together so innovation and enterprise can thrive. We enjoy the freedom to run our own lives and depend on the motivation, productivity, and creativity that comes from working with others.

Our vision is for a self-reliant rural economy rooted in the collaboration of local entrepreneurs.
