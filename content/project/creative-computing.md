Creative Computing is a course developed by an international network of educators passionate about exposing kids to the computer sciences.  Broken up into 7 units, this course uses the popular Scratch programming environment to teach kids the basics of coding.  Scratch is used over the world by students to easily create animations and games while acting as a stepping stone to the more advanced world of computer programming.

We're considering offering such a course in the Annapolis Valley.  Tell us what you think!
