Our monthly Refresh meetup is where the Annapolis Valley community of designers, developers and innovators come hang out.  Those interested in the creative, technical, and professional culture of digital technology endeavours in the Annapolis Valley meet and talk about all things design, technology, and entrepreneurship.

Refresh meets the second Tuesday evening of each month in the Wolfville area. These are casual affairs with short, member-interest talks followed by an opportunity to mingle.

**All are welcome** 

Join our **mailing list** (see below) to stay up-to-date about our upcoming meetups.

Big tip of the hat to the {{< organization "Acadia Entrepreneurship Centre" >}} for hosting our meetup and {{< organization "innovacorp" >}} for keeping the dream alive.
