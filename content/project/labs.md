The Refresh Annapolis Valley Labs is a playground where adventurous builders come to create.  Labs initiatives are community driven digital technology projects that tend to be entrepreneurial in nature.  In the lab, Refreshers work on building and applying their skills all while pursuing the objectives of their projects.

Refresh Annapolis Valley Labs is hosted at the Acadia Entrepreneurship Centre Rural Innovation Centre.  We meet on Saturdays from 12:30 to 3:30 starting January 26.  Bring your laptop.  Pizza will be served.
