After a 15 year career with various businesses and economic development organizations, Andrew felt it was about time to move from being a ‘cheerleader’ and ‘curator’ of entrepreneurship to doing something that actually produced more entrepreneurs in rural communities.

​In 2014 he founded [Mashup Lab](http://www.mashuplab.ca/); a for-more-than-profit company that activates rural ideas.  That same year he launched a chapter of the [Awesome Foundation](http://www.awesomesouthshore.ca/) in his community. Andrew has since gone on to launch another social enterprise - {{< organization "CO3" >}}, a fresh new coworking space for Freelancers, Entrepreneurs, and Independents located in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia.  

Andrew's work with over 1,000 Entrepreneurs located in rural has convinced him that great ideas can come from anywhere. His passion and energy is focused on one thing: unleashing entrepreneurial potential in rural communities that has yet to be inspired into action.
