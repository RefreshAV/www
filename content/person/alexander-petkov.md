Upon meeting Alex, many people describe him as robotic because they say he looks and acts very serious. This is far from the truth. In fact, Alex behaves very humanly and has many human-like interests and engages in many human-like activities. He is an intermediate-level Python programmer and enjoys tinkering with electronics. He is also passionate about entrepreneurship, computer engineering, and world history. In his free time, he engages in typical human-like recreational activities such as watching YouTube or Netflix or playing video games. Also, Alex can and will kick your ass in any hack and slash, stealth, or grand strategy game.
