Scott Olszowiec is creative partner that has been building solutions to communicate ideas and inspiration for over 17 years.

From digital content creation to educational technology, he is somewhere between what you might call "artsy" and "techie."

He has worked in a variety of ways with expedition travellers, universities, NSCC and private career colleges, global finance, non-profits, indigenous economic development and education organizations in Canada.

Most recently, Scott has partnered with Ulnooweg to assist in the implementation of a bold new project that aims to transform science and digital education for Miâ€™kmaw children and youth living on reserves.
