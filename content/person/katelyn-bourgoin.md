Katelyn Bourgoin is a 3X founder/business owner turned growth strategist. She helps frustrated marketers and business owners to figure out why customers aren’t buying and how they can fix it.

When companies know who their best customers are and what they *really* want, it becomes much easier to create awesome products and sell more of them. The result? Happier customers and more money in the bank.

Katelyn’s past clients include startups, small businesses, and Fortune 500s like Target and Holiday Inn. Suffice to say, she’s seen it all.

With vast experience as a marketer and product designer, today Katelyn works as a growth strategist & trainer. The majority of her clients are high-growth tech companies like Swept, LeadSift, and Spring Loaded.
