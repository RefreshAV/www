Hi, I'm Max! I'm a full stack web developer and designer with over 3 years of freelance experience and a lifetime of passion for building things!

I really enjoy learning new things and problem solving as a developer. As a designer, I love creating unique and engaging experiences. I am a very detail oriented person who puts a lot of emphasis into how people interact with the things I make.
