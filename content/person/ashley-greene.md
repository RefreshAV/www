Lawyer by training, reformed growth-hacker and marketer, and qualitative #datageek, Ashley is the CEO & Founder of Instratify and on a mission to empower the customer value maximization movement. Happier, more successful customers = happier investors. 

When Ashley's not doing Instratify duties or speaking at conferences, she's travelling for fun, a slight adrenaline junkie, obsessed with anything HBO produces, and fits in as many tennis matches as possible.
