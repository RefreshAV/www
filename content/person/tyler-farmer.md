For the last year and a half, Tyler has lead Digital Nova Scotia’s projects and skill development programs across Nova Scotia. Through this role, Tyler has had the opportunity to connect with a wide variety of ICT & digital tech companies, professional service providers, community leaders, and government agencies which has enabled him to build an effective grassroots network with a birds-eye perspective of the economic challenges facing the province. Prior to diving into the rewarding work of economic development through Nova Scotia’s IT association, Tyler coordinated inspection, expediting, and project management services for many of Canada’s leading oil and gas companies in Alberta. In his spare time, Tyler is often found running all over Halifax training for the Scotiabank Bluenose Marathon, scouting for the perfect photo opportunity in Cape Breton or passionately keeping up with the growing Canadian independent journalism and startup scenes.
