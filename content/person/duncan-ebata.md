I’ve worked primarily with food social enterprises and tech startups, so adaption and collaboration are in my bag. Whether it be branding for food social enterprises, promoting local investment funds, implementing community economic development strategies, hosting food community events, building entrepreneurial culture: building food communities and promoting social enterprises is what I do.

I’ve been on the ground growing food and beverage start-ups reach their first $100k in sales, promoting local investment funds to reach their first $1 million, and growing multi-million dollar retail food businesses with 30%+ yearly growth rates.

I’ve been fortunate to promote and grow amazing organizations like Just Us! Coffee, Taproot Farms, FarmWorks Investment Co-op, Slow Food in Canada, Common Roots Urban Farm, the Acadia Entrepreneurship Centre, Farmers Markets of Nova Scotia, Pie R Squared and many others dedicated to building a better food system.

I live with my lovely fiancee Anne Stieger in Wolfville, Nova Scotia.  I've run my own businesses for 7 years and I'm now lucky to work with amazing clients in 1 time zone now, instead of 5.
