With “a voice that sits between Roy Orbison and Dolly Parton,” Cassie Josephine provides a vintage sound to her deeply personal narratives (Jeff Liberty - CBC). Her latest collection of songs, Only Half Blue, is one she thinks of fondly as a fairytale of middle-aged proportions. With her backing band, The Cry If I Want To’s, Cassie’s dreamy anthems are brought to life with soaring harmonies, violin, piano, and electric guitar.

This singer-songwriter based in Halifax, NS is nominated for Best Country Artist in The Coast's Best of Halifax 2019 Reader's Choice Awards and Only Half Blue is nominated for Country Recording of the Year at NSMW 2019.
