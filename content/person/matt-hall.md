I make stuff happen at Agile*, an independent geoscience idea factory in Canada. 

We build awesome knowledge engines for organizations (mostly wikis), and we hone our skills in subsurface science... We have most recently been working on geothermal reservoir description. I've worked the Montney tight gas of Alberta and BC, frontier exploration in the Canadian Beaufort Sea, the Athabasca oil sands, the Norwegian North Sea. I also worked in software for several years, as an advocate of integrated volume visualization and interpretation and viz room pilot.

Since 2001 I've been a registered professional Geologist and professional Geophysicist in Alberta. I review technical papers for SEG's journal Geophysics. I sometimes teach university courses. With my Agile colleague, I write a blog at agilegeoscience.com.

Specialties: Seismic interpretation and analysis, sedimentology, sequence stratigraphy, geoscience software, integrated reservoir description, knowledge sharing, writing
