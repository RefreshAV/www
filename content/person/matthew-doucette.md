I am a video game developer (Xbox 360 & PC). Check out my video game company, [Xona Games](http://xona.com/), and my first professional video game, [Duality ZF](http://dualityzf.com/), for more information. My only parter is my twin brother, [Jason Doucette](http://www.jasondoucette.com/). 

Here is the Duality ZF April 2009 trailer:
